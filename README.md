client = OSRM::Client.new(host: 'example.com', port: 5000)

# Perform the request
distance = client.distance('40.723279,-73.937766', '40.90,-73.10', '40.82279,-73.937766')
route = client.route('40.723279,-73.937766', '40.90,-73.10', '40.823279,-73.937766')
locate = client.locate('53.911808, 27.595035')
nearest = client.nearest('53.911808, 27.595035')
```
To connect any special settings itâ€™s necessary to use block construction like the following one:

```ruby
route = client.route('40.723279,-73.937766', '40.90,-73.10', '40.823279,-73.937766') do |request| 
        request.add_param 'z', 7 
end
```
### Response
Response

There are 4 types of objects.

LocateCl extends base class.
There arise new qualities @lat and @lon which contain point position.

NearestCl extends Locate and adds new quality @name, which contains the name of object on the map.

DistanceCl contains in the distance quality the amount which reflects the distance between the points of the request. 

RouteCL contains geometry, summary, instructions, name qualities. If there is a necessity to get other qualities of the route, you need to call to them via orgin_response qulity of the parent class.
